### **Integrating Microservices with a Message Queue**
**Problem Statement**: Your microservice architecture includes separate services for inventory, payments, and shipping. These services need to communicate through a message queue (like ActiveMQ or RabbitMQ) to ensure reliable communication between them.

**Solution**:
- Use Camel routes to send and receive messages from the message queue for each microservice.
- Implement error handling and retry mechanisms using Camel’s `ErrorHandler` and `DeadLetterChannel` to ensure no message is lost.
- Use Camel’s AMQP or JMS component to communicate with RabbitMQ or ActiveMQ.
