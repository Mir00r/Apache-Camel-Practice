### **Event-Driven Architecture with Kafka**
**Problem Statement**: Your company needs to build an event-driven architecture where services publish and consume events related to user activity (e.g., user sign-ups, product searches). These events should be handled by a message broker like Kafka.

**Solution**:
- Use Camelâ€™s Kafka component to send and receive events from Kafka topics.
- Implement consumers that process different events (e.g., user sign-ups trigger welcome emails).
- Use Camel routes to transform events and publish them to appropriate topics for further processing.
