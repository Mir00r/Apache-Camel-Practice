### 5. **API Gateway for Third-Party Integration**
**Problem Statement**: Your company needs to expose a RESTful API that integrates with multiple third-party services like payment gateways,
shipping providers, and SMS services. The data formats and protocols used by these services are different, and some of them have performance
limitations (rate limits).

**Solution**:
- Create a Spring Boot API using Camel routes to route requests to different third-party services.
- Use Camel components like `rest`, `http4`, and `throttle` to handle API calls, transform request/response formats, and implement rate-limiting to respect service limitations.
- Aggregate results and return a unified response to the client.
