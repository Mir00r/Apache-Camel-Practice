### **Error Handling and Recovery in an ETL Process**
**Problem Statement**: You have an ETL process that extracts data from different data sources, transforms it, and loads it into a data warehouse. Sometimes data extraction fails due to network or data issues, and you need to implement error recovery and retries.

**Solution**:
- Implement a Camel route to handle data extraction, transformation, and loading.
- Use the `DeadLetterChannel` or `RedeliveryPolicy` to retry failed operations and move failed messages to an error queue for manual intervention.
- Use Camelâ€™s `Try-Catch` for granular error handling.
