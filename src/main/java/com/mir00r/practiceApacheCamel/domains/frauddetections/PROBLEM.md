### **Real-Time Fraud Detection in Financial Systems**
**Problem Statement**: Banks and financial institutions need to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time.
The system must be able to receive transaction data from various channels (credit card, online banking, ATMs)
and analyze it to flag suspicious behavior.

**Solution**:
- Use Camel to listen to real-time transaction data streams from different systems (using `Kafka`, `MQTT`, or `JMS` components).
- Implement complex event processing (CEP) with Camel’s `DSL` to detect patterns of fraudulent behavior.
- Camel’s `Splitter` and `Aggregator` patterns can be used to break down and reassemble transactional data for analysis.
- Forward suspicious transactions to a fraud detection system or service for deeper analysis, while ensuring compliance (e.g., PCI-DSS) using security components.
