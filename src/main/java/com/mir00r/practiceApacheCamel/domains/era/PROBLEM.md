### **Enterprise Message Routing and Aggregation**
**Problem Statement**: Your business receives purchase orders from multiple channels (email, REST API, FTP), but they must all be aggregated into a single, unified format and delivered to the order-processing system.

**Solution**:
- Set up Camel routes that listen to different endpoints: email (IMAP/POP), FTP, and REST.
- Use a content-based router in Camel to route these messages based on their origin, aggregate the data into a common format, and forward it to the processing system.
