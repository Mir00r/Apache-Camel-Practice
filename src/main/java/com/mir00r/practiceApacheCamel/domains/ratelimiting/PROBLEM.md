###  **API Rate Limiting and Monitoring**
**Problem Statement**: Your service communicates with a third-party API that has strict rate limits. You need to ensure your service doesn’t exceed the allowed number of requests per minute while still processing client requests efficiently.

**Solution**:
- Use Camel’s `Throttler` EIP (Enterprise Integration Pattern) to control the rate of requests sent to the third-party API.
- Implement monitoring using Camel’s `Metrics` or `Log` component to track and log the number of requests sent.
